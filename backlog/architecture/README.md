# Architecture Backlog

Dedicated backlog lane for architecture decision and design artifacts.

## States
- `intake/`: raw architecture ideas or decision requests
- `ready/`: refined architecture stories ready for execution
- `active/`: architecture story in execution
- `qa/`: architecture QA/review pending
- `blocked/`: waiting on dependency
- `done/`: accepted architecture output
- `archive/`: historical closed architecture items

## Core Flow
`intake -> ready -> active -> qa -> done`
