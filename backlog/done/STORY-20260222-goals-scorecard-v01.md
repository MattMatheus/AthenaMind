## Problem Statement
The system needs explicit v0.1 goal targets so sprint planning can prioritize by measurable outcomes instead of intuition.

  - Define target bands for scorecard metrics
  - Publish accepted decision artifact
- Out:
  - Long-term v2.0 KPI planning

## Acceptance Criteria
1. v0.1 goals and metric target bands are documented.
2. Targets map to existing metrics from ADR-0002.
3. A decision record is created or updated and referenced from planning docs.

## QA Checks
- Test coverage updated
- Tests pass
- No known regressions in touched scope

## Dependencies
- `research/decisions/ADR-0002-north-star-and-success-metrics.md`
- `PM-TODO.md`

## Notes
