# Story: Create Phased Implementation Plan (v0.1 -> v0.3)

## Metadata
- `id`: STORY-20260222-phased-plan-v01-v03
- `owner_persona`: Software Architect - Ada.md
- `status`: qa

## Problem Statement
The research backlog calls for a phased plan, but no execution-ready phase breakdown exists for team operation.

## Scope
- In:
  - Define phase goals, entry/exit criteria, and dependencies
  - Map each phase to accepted ADR constraints
  - Produce implementation sequence and risk notes
- Out:
  - Detailed task-level implementation stories

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A phased plan artifact exists covering v0.1, v0.2, v0.3.
2. Each phase includes success gates and major risks.
3. The plan is reflected in research roadmap and handoff.

## QA Checks
- Test coverage updated
- Tests pass
- No known regressions in touched scope

## Dependencies
- `research/roadmap/RESEARCH_BACKLOG.md`
- ADR-0001 through ADR-0007

## Notes
- Current top `Now` research item.
