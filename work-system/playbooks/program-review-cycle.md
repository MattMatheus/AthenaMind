# Program Review Cycle Playbook

Run after PM refinement or before release checkpoint.

## Steps
1. Validate queue and artifact consistency:
   - `scripts/test_program_state_consistency.sh`
2. Update `research/roadmap/PROGRAM_STATE_BOARD.md` counts and Now/Next.
3. Confirm PM TODO `Now` has actionable next items.
4. Confirm phase and ADR traceability fields for intake stories.
5. Decide whether a release bundle should be created or updated.
