# Research Workspace

Purpose: planning-first workspace for the AthenaMind pivot.

## Structure
- ingest/: raw founder notes and source material drop zone
- briefs/: synthesized research briefs and summaries
- architecture/: system design drafts, tradeoff docs, interfaces
- product/: user personas, JTBD, requirements, PRDs
- decisions/: ADRs and decision logs
- competitive/: market/landscape analysis
- references/: external papers, links, citations, excerpts
- roadmap/: milestone plans and sequencing
- risks/: assumptions, risk register, mitigation plans

## Workflow (80/20)
1. Drop raw inputs into ingest/.
2. Synthesize in briefs/ with explicit assumptions.
3. Convert to concrete decisions in decisions/ + architecture/.
4. Keep roadmap/ tied to decisions, not ideas.
