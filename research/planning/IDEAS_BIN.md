# Ideas Bin

Deferred ideas captured during planning. These are intentionally out of immediate v1 implementation scope.

## Memory System Future Concepts
- Multi-backend memory support for layers 2 and 3.
- Centralized memory system that migrates CLI behavior into an API wrapper.
- Container-hosted API integration for memory operations.
- Human-facing UI to inspect and explore memory contents ("view the brain").

## Promotion Rule
- Promote an idea from this bin only through a new planning session or explicit PM refinement decision.
