# Research Backlog

## Completed
- Define memory system north star and success metrics.
- Freeze v0.1 goals and scorecard target bands (`ADR-0008`).
- Map 3-pillar architecture into concrete module boundaries.
- Define MVP constraints (cost, latency, traceability, reliability).
- Evaluate storage/embedding options for local-first mode.
- Define governance and human-in-the-loop controls.
- Re-baseline scope to memory-layer-only for v0.1.
- Create phased implementation plan (v0.1 -> v0.3): `research/roadmap/PHASED_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V01_V03.md`

## Now
- Competitive positioning and differentiation memo.

## Next
- Dogfooding loop design and telemetry KPI set.
- Formalize state-transition checklist for active -> qa -> done flow.

## Later
- v2.0 exploration: centralized/swarm memory and multi-operator governance model.
