# Research Backlog

## Completed
- Define memory system north star and success metrics.
- Freeze v0.1 goals and scorecard target bands (`ADR-0008`).
- Map 3-pillar architecture into concrete module boundaries.
- Define MVP constraints (cost, latency, traceability, reliability).
- Evaluate storage/embedding options for local-first mode.
- Define governance and human-in-the-loop controls.
- Re-baseline scope to memory-layer-only for v0.1.
- Create phased implementation plan (v0.1 -> v0.3): `research/roadmap/PHASED_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V01_V03.md`
- Competitive positioning and differentiation memo: `research/competitive/COMPETITIVE_POSITIONING_AND_DIFFERENTIATION_MEMO_2026-02-22.md`
- Dogfooding loop design and telemetry KPI set: `research/roadmap/DOGFOODING_LOOP_AND_TELEMETRY_KPI_SET_V01.md`
- Pillars ingest coverage audit and archival disposition: `research/references/PILLARS_INGEST_COVERAGE_AUDIT_2026-02-22.md`

## Now
- Program state consistency and release-checkpoint adoption.
- First KPI snapshot publication and trend interpretation.

## Next
- v0.2 candidate research based on v0.1 evidence.
- Verify external claims from `research/ingest/memory-best-practices.md` against primary sources and local measurements.

## Later
- v2.0 exploration: centralized/swarm memory and multi-operator governance model.
