# Founder Snapshot

## Metadata
- `updated_at`: 2026-02-22
- `owner`: founder/operator
- `purpose`: one-screen progress view while stages are running

## Current State (v0.1)
- Phase: `in-progress`
- Focus: memory-layer reliability, governance, KPI evidence, and release-checkpoint discipline
- Scope guardrail: memory-layer only (no runtime/pod ownership)

## This Week: Now
1. Execute `STORY-20260222-memory-cli-telemetry-contract-v01` to complete deterministic KPI event emission.
2. Execute `STORY-20260222-mvp-constraint-enforcement-v01` to harden fail-closed v0.1 governance gates.
3. Use `work-system/metrics/KPI_SNAPSHOT_2026-02-22_BASELINE.md` as baseline and publish a follow-up KPI delta snapshot after telemetry story completion.

## Next Up
1. Execute `STORY-20260222-release-checkpoint-bundle-v01` to formalize `done` versus `shipped`.
2. Promote `STORY-20260222-dogfood-semantic-retrieval-hardening-v01` from intake once telemetry baseline is stable.
3. Sequence deferred phase work (`v0.2` snapshot MVP, `v0.3` API read gateway) using checkpoint evidence.

## Progress Signals
- Engineering done stories: `19`
- Architecture done stories: `11`
- Engineering active stories: `4`
- Engineering intake stories: `1`

## Founder Checkpoints
1. Confirm `done` vs `shipped` boundary is explicit in release bundle.
2. Confirm KPI reporting cadence is active and references the baseline snapshot.
3. Confirm retrieval quality and trace completeness move out of `Red` band in the next KPI cycle.

## Refresh Guidance
- Update this page after PM refinement cycles or whenever `PROGRAM_STATE_BOARD.md` priorities change.
- Keep this page summary-only; never duplicate policy details that already live in canonical docs.
