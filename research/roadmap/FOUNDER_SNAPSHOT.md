# Founder Snapshot

## Metadata
- `updated_at`: 2026-02-22
- `owner`: founder/operator
- `purpose`: one-screen progress view while stages are running

## Current State (v0.1)
- Phase: `in-progress`
- Focus: memory-layer reliability, governance, KPI evidence, and release-checkpoint discipline
- Scope guardrail: memory-layer only (no runtime/pod ownership)

## This Week: Now
1. Run PM refinement now that engineering active queue is empty.
2. Keep release decision at `hold` until checkpoint risks are reduced.
3. Publish follow-up KPI delta snapshot against `work-system/metrics/KPI_SNAPSHOT_2026-02-22_BASELINE.md`.

## Next Up
1. Promote `STORY-20260222-dogfood-semantic-retrieval-hardening-v01` from intake after PM refinement ranking.
2. Sequence post-v0.1 deferred roadmap work using release-checkpoint evidence.
3. Rebaseline KPI trend expectations after the next release-bound cycle.

## Progress Signals
- Engineering done stories: `23`
- Architecture done stories: `11`
- Engineering active stories: `0`
- Engineering intake stories: `1`

## Founder Checkpoints
1. Confirm `done` vs `shipped` boundary is explicit in release bundle.
2. Confirm KPI reporting cadence is active and references the baseline snapshot.
3. Confirm retrieval quality and trace completeness move out of `Red` band in the next KPI cycle.

- Update this page after PM refinement cycles or whenever `PROGRAM_STATE_BOARD.md` priorities change.
- Keep this page summary-only; never duplicate policy details that already live in canonical docs.
