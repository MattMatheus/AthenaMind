# Founder Snapshot

## Metadata
- `updated_at`: 2026-02-22
- `owner`: founder/operator
- `purpose`: one-screen progress view while stages are running

## Current State (v0.1)
- Phase: `in-progress`
- Focus: memory-layer reliability, governance, and release-checkpoint discipline
- Scope guardrail: memory-layer only (no runtime/pod ownership)

## This Week: Now
1. Run PM refinement because engineering active queue is currently empty.
2. Create first release checkpoint bundle before declaring shipped scope.
3. Publish first KPI snapshot and interpret trend vs ADR-0008 target bands.

## Next Up
1. Program state consistency and release-checkpoint adoption hardening.
2. v0.2 candidate research based on v0.1 evidence.
3. Verify external claims from `research/ingest/memory-best-practices.md` with primary sources and local measurements.

## Progress Signals
- Engineering done stories: `15`
- Architecture done stories: `6`
- Engineering active stories: `0`
- Engineering intake stories: `0`

## Founder Checkpoints
1. Confirm `done` vs `shipped` boundary is explicit in release bundle.
2. Confirm KPI reporting cadence is active (weekly snapshot exists).
3. Confirm any new memory-technique adoption references rubric status (`Adopted|Trial|Deferred|Rejected`).

- Update this page after PM refinement cycles or whenever `PROGRAM_STATE_BOARD.md`/`RESEARCH_BACKLOG.md` priorities change.
- Keep this page summary-only; never duplicate policy details that already live in canonical docs.
