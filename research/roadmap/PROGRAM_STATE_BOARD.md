# Program State Board

## Metadata
- `updated_at`: 2026-02-22
- `owner`: personas/Product Manager - Maya.md
- `policy`: no time estimates; quality-gated flow only

## Queue Snapshot
- `engineering_intake_count`: 8
- `engineering_active_count`: 0
- `engineering_qa_count`: 0
- `engineering_done_story_count`: 15
- `architecture_intake_count`: 0
- `architecture_active_count`: 0
- `architecture_qa_count`: 0
- `architecture_done_story_count`: 11

## Phase Status
- `v0.1`: in-progress (core memory CLI baseline and governance gates implemented)
- `v0.2`: not started
- `v0.3`: not started

## Now
- Run PM refinement to rank and promote refilled engineering intake into active.
- Create first release checkpoint bundle for shipped v0.1 increments.
- Publish first KPI snapshot and compare against ADR-0008 target bands.

## Next
- Formalize first v0.1 release boundary after release bundle review.
- Run recurring KPI snapshot cadence from `work-system/metrics/KPI_SNAPSHOT_TEMPLATE.md`.

## Risks
- Strategic docs can drift from backlog state without enforced consistency tests.
- `done` volume can create false confidence without release checkpoint evidence.
