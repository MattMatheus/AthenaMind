# Program State Board

## Metadata
- `updated_at`: 2026-02-23
- `owner`: personas/Product Manager - Maya.md
- `policy`: no time estimates; quality-gated flow only

## Queue Snapshot
- `engineering_intake_count`: 0
- `engineering_active_count`: 0
- `engineering_qa_count`: 0
- `engineering_done_story_count`: 33
- `architecture_intake_count`: 0
- `architecture_active_count`: 0
- `architecture_qa_count`: 0
- `architecture_done_story_count`: 11

## Phase Status
- `v0.1`: in-progress (core memory CLI baseline and governance gates implemented)
- `v0.2`: not started
- `v0.3`: not started

## Now
- Run PM refinement because engineering active queue is empty after Clara documentation completion.
- Confirm released bundle scope remains aligned to backlog state after QA closure.
- Keep weekly KPI monitoring active to ensure post-hardening quality remains inside target bands.

## Next
- Sequence deferred roadmap work only after PM confirms release-checkpoint closure and queue refresh.
- Rebaseline founder snapshot signals against the refreshed release bundle.
- Continue weekly KPI cadence to verify post-hardening trends hold.

## Risks
- Strategic docs can drift from backlog state without enforced consistency tests.
- `done` volume can create false confidence without release checkpoint evidence.
- Release bundle scope/evidence can go stale if checkpoint-refresh control-plane story is skipped.
