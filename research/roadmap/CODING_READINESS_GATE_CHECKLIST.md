# Coding Readiness Gate Checklist

## Purpose
Establish one explicit pre-coding quality/process checkpoint before memory-layer implementation stories begin.

## Gate Checklist
1. Pre-coding path document exists and is current (`PRE_CODING_PATH.md`).
2. Pre-coding prerequisite stories are closed through QA and moved to `backlog/engineering/done/`.
3. Required QA result artifacts exist for prerequisite stories.
4. Required engineering test scripts pass for all prerequisite stories.
5. Active queue order is clear and blockers are ranked.
6. Go/no-go decision artifact is recorded with rationale and blocker list.

## Applied Run (2026-02-22)
- Story: `backlog/engineering/active/STORY-20260222-coding-readiness-gate.md`
- Checklist applied by engineering cycle before coding sprint start.

Checklist results:
- 1) PASS
- 2) PASS
- 3) PASS
- 4) PASS
- 5) PASS
- 6) PASS

Result summary:
- `GO` for coding sprint start at this checkpoint.
- Prior blockers are closed through QA and tracked in `backlog/engineering/done/`.
