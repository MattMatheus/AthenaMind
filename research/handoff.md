# Research Handoff

## Produced
- Governance finalized:
  - `research/decisions/ADR-0006-governance-and-hitl-policy.md` (`Accepted`)
- Vision workshop completed through Set 4:
  - `research/product/VISION_WORKSHOP_2026-02-22.md`
- Backlog progression update:
  - `research/roadmap/RESEARCH_BACKLOG.md`
- Phased delivery sequence finalized:
  - `research/roadmap/PHASED_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V01_V03.md`

## Why It Matters Now
- Governance blockers are resolved with explicit policy values.
- Scope and policy now align to local single-operator memory-layer product direction.
- Phase-by-phase execution gates now exist for v0.1, v0.2, and v0.3 planning.

## Validation
- Founder selections ingested directly:
  - review-first default with operator override
  - strict memory-operation budgets
  - mandatory review for medium/high risk classes
  - operator as sole override authority
- Consistent with `ADR-0007` memory-layer-only scope.

## Open Questions
- None blocking current engineering planning.

## Recommended Next Item
- Competitive positioning and differentiation memo.
