# Research Handoff

## What was produced
- Competitive positioning and differentiation memo:
  - `research/competitive/COMPETITIVE_POSITIONING_AND_DIFFERENTIATION_MEMO_2026-02-22.md`
- Backlog progression update:
  - `research/roadmap/RESEARCH_BACKLOG.md`
- Research seed prompt progression update:
  - `research/research-agent-seed-prompt.md`

## Why those outputs matter now
- The project now has a clear market-facing position that is consistent with accepted memory-layer scope and governance constraints.
- Differentiation is documented in execution terms (policy, audit, retrieval precision, local-first strategy), which can guide both roadmap sequencing and GTM narrative.
- The research queue is now advanced to the next high-leverage item.

## Validation performed
- Traceability check against accepted context:
  - `ADR-0001` through `ADR-0007`, `ADR-0008`, and `research/product/VISION_WORKSHOP_2026-02-22.md`.
- Scope guardrail check:
  - memo explicitly excludes runtime execution orchestration and container lifecycle ownership for v0.1.
- Roadmap consistency check:
  - positioning implications align with `research/roadmap/PHASED_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V01_V03.md`.

## Open questions for next cycle
- Which competitor set should be designated as canonical for source-validated comparison in the next pass?
- What minimum evidence threshold should convert assumption-based differentiation claims into validated claims?
- Which KPI definitions should be locked first for dogfooding loops (continuity success, rework reduction, trusted autonomy, or trace completeness)?

## Recommended next backlog item
- Dogfooding loop design and telemetry KPI set.
