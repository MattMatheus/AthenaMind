## Getting Help

1. Check docs index: [knowledge-base/INDEX.md](knowledge-base/INDEX.md)
2. Check troubleshooting: [knowledge-base/troubleshooting/README.md](knowledge-base/troubleshooting/README.md)
3. Open a public issue for non-sensitive bugs or feature requests.

## Public Testing Feedback

Use:
- Bug template for defects and regressions.
- Usability template for operator friction and docs gaps.

## Private Escalation

Use private channels for:
- security concerns
- secret exposure
- compliance-sensitive telemetry incidents

When escalating, include exact commit hash, commands run, and observed/expected behavior.
