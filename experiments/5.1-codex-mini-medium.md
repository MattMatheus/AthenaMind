# 5.1 Codex Mini Medium Experiment

## Summary
- Began by onboarding through `AGENTS.md`, `HUMANS.md`, and workflow docs to understand the staged flow, memory-layer focus, and skill mappings.
- Created branch `codex/experiment2` to isolate new work, then authored `knowledge-base/process/QUICK_START.md` so less-capable agents can follow precise steps, branch/signal checks, and memory CLI reminders without diving into every policy file.
- Prioritized memory-layer awareness by linking stage actions to the AthenaMind skill commands and noting the value of context snapshots before decision points.

## Results
- Added a deterministic quick-start guide covering branch/command checks, queue interpretation, stage exit policies, and explicit AthenaMind memory CLI invocations, aiming to conserve context and reduce reasoning burden for weaker agents.
- Document emphasized existing policies (commit/observer rules, backlog weighting) and provided a simple run-through list so the work system remains consistent even if some agents skip longer docs.

## Next Steps
1. Align the quick-start doc with any future changes to stage commands or commit rules and keep it rebased with the source-of-truth docs (`HUMANS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_CYCLE.md`).
2. Consider expanding the quick-start with short scripts or templates (e.g., queue-checker, memory CLI helper) if the experiment shows the guidance is still too dense for certain agents.
3. Once new work is queued, run the appropriate stage launcher (`./tools/launch_stage.sh pm` if queues empty) and capture the next cycle context with `memory-cli` before launching engineering.
