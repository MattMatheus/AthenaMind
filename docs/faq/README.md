## Summary

## Intended Audience
- New and existing users seeking quick clarification without reading full guides.
- Support and QA operators answering common product questions.

## Preconditions
- Questions should be mapped to current accepted behavior only.
- Answers should reference source-of-truth decisions or validated workflows.

## Main Flow

2. Keep each answer short and source-linked.
3. Update answers after behavior changes.
4. Remove stale duplicates.

## Failure Modes
