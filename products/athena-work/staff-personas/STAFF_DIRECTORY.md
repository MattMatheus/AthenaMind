# Staff Directory

This file is the canonical role index for agent persona selection.

## How Agents Should Use This
1. Start here to choose the correct role persona.
2. Open the selected persona file and follow its template sections exactly.
3. Stay within AthenaMind v0.1 memory-layer scope unless explicitly directed otherwise.

## Template Schema
Each persona file follows the same structure:
1. `Role`
2. `Mission`
3. `Scope`
4. `Inputs Required`
5. `Outputs Required`
6. `Workflow Template`
7. `Quality Checklist`
8. `Handoff Template`
9. `Constraints`

## Staff Roster
- `Product Manager - Maya.md`
- `Software Architect - Ada.md`
- `QA Engineer - Iris.md`
- `SDET - Theo.md`
- `SRE - Nia.md`
- `Technical Writer - Clara.md`
- `Database Expert - Rowan.md`

## Scope Guardrail
AthenaMind v0.1 is memory-layer only. Runtime orchestration/container lifecycle ownership is out of scope unless explicitly requested.
