# Story: Execute Coding Readiness Gate and Go/No-Go Decision

## Metadata
- `id`: STORY-20260222-coding-readiness-gate
- `owner_persona`: Product Manager - Maya.md
- `status`: done

## Problem Statement
Before coding starts, we need one explicit go/no-go checkpoint to confirm process, QA, and test discipline are stable.

## Scope
- In:
  - Define coding readiness gate checklist
  - Verify completion of pre-coding stories and QA outcomes
  - Record explicit go/no-go decision with blockers if any
- Out:
  - Implementing memory-layer code

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A coding readiness checklist exists and is applied.
2. A go/no-go decision artifact is produced with rationale.
3. Any blockers are converted into ranked backlog stories.

## QA Checks
- Test coverage updated
- Tests pass
- No known regressions in touched scope

## Dependencies
- `knowledge-base/process/PRE_CODING_PATH.md`
- Completion of pre-coding active stories

## Notes
- Final step before beginning coding sprint stories.
