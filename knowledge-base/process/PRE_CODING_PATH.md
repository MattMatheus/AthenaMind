# Pre-Coding Path (Manual PM Plan)

Purpose: complete process and quality hardening before memory-layer implementation code.

## Phase 1: Cycle Control Hardening
Outcome: deterministic backlog state movement and QA consistency.

Stories:
1. `delivery-backlog/engineering/done/STORY-20260222-state-transition-checklist.md`
2. `delivery-backlog/engineering/done/STORY-20260222-qa-regression-rubric.md`

## Phase 2: Validation and Operator Discipline
Outcome: repeatable test/validation flow and clear operator runbook.

Stories:
3. `delivery-backlog/engineering/done/STORY-20260222-doc-test-harness-standardization.md`
4. `delivery-backlog/engineering/done/STORY-20260222-founder-operator-workflow.md`
5. `delivery-backlog/engineering/done/STORY-20260222-docs-navigation-hardening.md`

## Phase 3: Coding Readiness Gate
Outcome: explicit go/no-go decision for coding start.

Stories:
6. `delivery-backlog/engineering/done/STORY-20260222-coding-readiness-gate.md`

Gate artifacts:
- `product-research/roadmap/CODING_READINESS_GATE_CHECKLIST.md`
- `product-research/roadmap/CODING_READINESS_DECISION_2026-02-22.md` (`GO`)

## External Dependency
- `delivery-backlog/engineering/done/STORY-20260222-phased-plan-v01-v03.md` is closed through QA.

## Deferred (Not Pre-Coding Critical Path)
- `delivery-backlog/engineering/done/STORY-20260222-memory-snapshot-plan.md` (post-v0.1 feature planning)
