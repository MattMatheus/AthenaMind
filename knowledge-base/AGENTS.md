# AGENTS

Agent-facing documentation rules for this project docs wiki.

## Workspace Scope
- Operate within this repository.
- Follow repository guardrails and backlog stage rules.

## Progressive Disclosure Contract (Mandatory)
For every docs page:
1. `Summary` (what this page is, why it matters)
2. `How It Works` (main flow)
3. `Details` (constraints, edge cases, references)

Readers should be able to stop after Summary/How It Works and still act correctly.

## Documentation Quality Rules
- Prefer concise, operational language.
- Link to source-of-truth artifacts (ADRs, prompts, backlog docs).
- Remove stale or superseded instructions aggressively.
- Keep examples realistic and directly executable when possible.

## Required Sections for New Docs
- Summary
- Intended Audience
- Preconditions
- Main Flow
- Failure Modes
- References
