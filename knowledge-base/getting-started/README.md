# Getting Started

## Summary
Start here to install prerequisites and run AthenaMind memory CLI workflows end to end.

## Intended Audience
- New users evaluating AthenaMind v0.1 memory-layer capabilities.
- Internal operators onboarding to user-facing product workflows.

## Preconditions
- Local clone of this repository.
- Go toolchain installed (`go.mod` minimum applies).
- Terminal access on macOS or Linux.

## Main Flow
1. Complete environment setup in `installation.md`.
2. Run the first successful path in `quickstart.md`.
3. Continue with command depth in `../cli/README.md`.
4. Use `../troubleshooting/README.md` for failures.

## Failure Modes
- Toolchain version mismatch blocks command execution.
- Missing environment setup causes test failures.
- Ambiguous workflow intent causes invalid command usage.
