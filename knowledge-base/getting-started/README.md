# Getting Started

## Summary

This section gets you from zero to a working AthenaMind memory workflow quickly, then branches into AthenaWork operating flows.

## Audience

- Engineers and data scientists who want to run or tune memory-assisted coding workflows.
- Technical operators preparing telemetry and governance gates for real usage.

## Paths

1. [Installation](/Users/foundry/Experiments/Current/AthenaMind/knowledge-base/getting-started/installation.md)
2. [AthenaMind Quickstart](/Users/foundry/Experiments/Current/AthenaMind/knowledge-base/getting-started/quickstart.md)
3. [AthenaWork Quickstart](/Users/foundry/Experiments/Current/AthenaMind/knowledge-base/getting-started/athenawork-quickstart.md)

## Next Steps

- Command deep dive: [CLI Commands](/Users/foundry/Experiments/Current/AthenaMind/knowledge-base/cli/commands.md)
- End-to-end flows: [Workflows](/Users/foundry/Experiments/Current/AthenaMind/knowledge-base/workflows/README.md)
- Telemetry export setup: [OTel/OTLP Setup](/Users/foundry/Experiments/Current/AthenaMind/knowledge-base/how-to/MEMORY_CLI_OTEL_SETUP.md)
