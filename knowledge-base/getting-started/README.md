# Getting Started

## Summary

This section gets you from zero to a working AthenaMind memory workflow quickly, then branches into AthenaWork operating flows.

## Audience

- Engineers and data scientists who want to run or tune memory-assisted coding workflows.
- Technical operators preparing telemetry and governance gates for real usage.
