# AthenaWork Cycle Overview

## Summary

This is the high-level loop used to run governed delivery cycles around AthenaMind changes.

## Cycle Steps

1. Plan or intake work.
2. Execute engineering changes.
3. Run QA validation.
4. Record observer/report outcomes.
5. Refine queue priorities.

## Operator Pack

In slim mode, AthenaWork execution scripts and full queue artifacts are archived at:
- `/Users/foundry/Experiments/Archived/AthenaMind-internal-2026-02-24/products/athena-work`

## Practical Guidance

Use AthenaMind workflows in this repo for user-facing validation, and run full AthenaWork stage scripts from the archived pack when you need full operational control-plane behavior.
