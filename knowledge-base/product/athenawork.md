# AthenaWork Product Guide

## What AthenaWork Is

AthenaWork is the staged operational workflow used to plan, execute, verify, and refine work around Athena products.

## Why AthenaMind Users Should Care

AthenaMind quality depends on disciplined operating loops. AthenaWork provides:
- queueing and prioritization,
- explicit stage gates,
- QA validation,
- cycle closure discipline.

## Stage Model

- `planning`: shape ambiguous work.
- `architect`: define architecture contracts.
- `engineering`: implement queued work.
- `qa`: verify behavior and regressions.
- `pm`: refine intake and reprioritize queue.
- `cycle`: engineering+qa repeat loop.

## Operator Pack Location (Slim Repo)

Full AthenaWork operator files are archived at:
- `/Users/foundry/Experiments/Archived/AthenaMind-internal-2026-02-24/products/athena-work`

## What Is Preserved In This Repo

- User-facing documentation that explains how AthenaWork relates to AthenaMind usage.
- Cross-links to onboarding and workflow guidance.

## Typical Use Pattern

1. Use AthenaMind quickstart and workflows to validate behavior.
2. Run AthenaWork stage loops from the archived operator pack for governed delivery.
3. Feed results back into AthenaMind configuration and tests.
