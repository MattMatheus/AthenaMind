# Process Metrics

Track process health over time.

## Core KPIs
- Story lead time (active -> done)
- QA turnaround time (qa -> done/active)
- Defect escape rate
- Reopen rate
- Handoff completeness score
- Retrieval quality gate pass rate (for memory evaluation harness)
- Traceability completeness rate (stories with phase/ADR/metric metadata)

## Usage Rule
- Snapshot cadence is event-driven (for example post-refinement or pre-release), not time-estimate based.
