# Program State Board

## Metadata
- `updated_at`: 2026-02-25
- `owner`: staff-personas/Product Manager - Maya.md
- `policy`: no time estimates; quality-gated flow only

## Queue Snapshot
- `engineering_intake_count`: 0
- `engineering_active_count`: 0
- `engineering_qa_count`: 0
- `engineering_done_story_count`: 44
- `architecture_intake_count`: 0
- `architecture_active_count`: 0
- `architecture_qa_count`: 0
- `architecture_done_story_count`: 11

## Phase Status
- `v0.1`: in-progress (core memory CLI baseline and governance gates implemented)
- `v0.2`: not started
- `v0.3`: not started

## Now
- Replenish engineering active queue via PM refinement.
- Keep retrieval quality monitoring active after semantic-boundary chunking rollout.
- Keep weekly KPI monitoring active while queue throughput resumes.

## Next
- Re-run QA on queued items and update release-checkpoint evidence for changed scope.
- Rebaseline founder snapshot signals after first post-refresh engineering/QA cycles.
- Track retrieval quality deltas for semantic-boundary chunking in the next evaluation cycle.

## Risks
- Strategic docs can drift from backlog state without enforced consistency tests.
- `done` volume can create false confidence without release checkpoint evidence.
- Release bundle scope/evidence can go stale if checkpoint-refresh control-plane story is skipped.
